I ntroduction:
H	ouse Price Prediction


⦁	The real estate market is a dynamic and complex arena, where property values can fluctuate significantly due to a multitude of factors. For both homebuyers and sellers, accurately determining the fair market value of a property is of paramount importance.
⦁	In this era of technological advancement, machine learning has emerged as a game-changing tool in the realm of real estate. One of its most compelling applications is predicting house prices with remarkable accuracy.
⦁	Traditional methods of property valuation, relying on factors such as location, square footage, and recent sales data, are undoubtedly useful. However, they often fall short in capturing the intricacies and nuances that drive real estate market dynamics.
⦁	Machine learning, on the other hand, has the capability to process vast volumes of data and identify patterns that human appraisers might overlook. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we value real estate, offering more precise and data-driven predictions.
⦁	In this exploration, we delve into the exciting world of predicting house prices using machine learning. We will uncover how this cutting-edge technology harnesses the power of algorithms and data to create predictive models that consider an array of variables, such as neighborhood characteristics, property features, economic indicators, and even social trends.
⦁	By doing so, machine learning enables us to make informed, data- backed predictions about the future value of a property.



⦁	This transformation of the real estate industry is not only beneficial for buyers and sellers but also for investors, developers, and policymakers. Accurate house price predictions can inform investment decisions, urban planning, and housing policy development, leading to a more efficient and equitable real estate market.
⦁	As we embark on this journey into the realm of machine learning for house price prediction, we will explore the various techniques, data sources, and challenges involved.

⦁	Data Exploration:
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Check for the presence of missing values, outliers, and data types of each feature.


⦁	Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values by either removing rows with missing data or imputing values based on the nature of the data.



⦁	Feature Selection:
Identify relevant features for house price prediction. Features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and amenities are often important.
We are selecting numerical features which have more than 0.50 or less than -0.50 correlation rate based on Pearson Correlation Method—which is the default value of parameter "method" in corr()  function. As for	selecting categorical features, I selected the categorical values which  I  believe  have significant effect on the target variable such as Heating and MSZoning.
